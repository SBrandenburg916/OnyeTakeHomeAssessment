# HIPAA Compliance & Security Plan for AI-Powered FHIR System

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security architecture and HIPAA compliance strategy for our AI-powered FHIR query system. The solution implements defense-in-depth security principles with particular emphasis on protecting Protected Health Information (PHI) throughout the data lifecycle.

## Authentication & Authorization

### SMART on FHIR Integration
- **OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect**: Implement SMART on FHIR specification for secure authentication
- **Authorization Code Flow**: Use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for enhanced security
- **Scopes Management**: Implement granular scopes (patient/*.read, user/*.read, etc.)
- **Token Management**: 
  - Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
  - Refresh tokens with rotation
  - Secure token storage using HttpOnly cookies

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Mandatory MFA for all healthcare providers
- Support for FIDO2/WebAuthn, TOTP, and SMS backup
- Adaptive authentication based on risk assessment

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### User Roles & Permissions
- **Healthcare Provider**: Full patient data access within their organization
- **Nurse**: Limited access to assigned patients
- **Admin**: System administration, no direct PHI access
- **Analyst**: Aggregated, de-identified data only
- **AI Researcher**: Synthetic/anonymized datasets only

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Patient relationship validation
- Time-based access restrictions
- Location-based access controls
- Department-specific data access

## Data Privacy & Protection

### Data Classification
- **PHI (Protected Health Information)**: Full HIPAA protections
- **De-identified Data**: Statistical analysis only
- **Synthetic Data**: Training and development purposes
- **Metadata**: Audit logs and system operations

### Encryption Standards
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all databases
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum for all communications
- **Key Management**: FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliant HSM
- **Database Encryption**: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)

### Data Minimization
- Query result filtering based on user permissions
- Automatic PHI redaction for unauthorized users
- Time-based data retention policies
- Automated data purging for expired records

## Audit Logging & Monitoring

### Comprehensive Audit Trail
- **User Activities**: All data access, queries, and modifications
- **System Events**: Authentication, authorization failures, configuration changes
- **Data Flows**: PHI access patterns and data transfers
- **AI Model Usage**: Query processing and result generation

### Log Structure (FHIR AuditEvent)
```json
{
  "resourceType": "AuditEvent",
  "type": {
    "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/audit-event-type",
    "code": "rest"
  },
  "recorded": "2025-07-02T14:30:00Z",
  "agent": [{
    "who": {"reference": "Practitioner/123"},
    "requestor": true
  }],
  "source": {
    "site": "AI-FHIR-System",
    "identifier": {"value": "query-service-v1"}
  },
  "entity": [{
    "what": {"reference": "Patient/456"},
    "type": {"code": "1", "display": "Person"},
    "role": {"code": "1", "display": "Patient"}
  }]
}
```

### Real-time Monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring
- Bulk data export alerts
- Suspicious query pattern detection

## Technical Security Controls

### Application Security
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all NLP inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and input sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based CSRF prevention

### Infrastructure Security
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated VLAN for healthcare applications
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Protection against common attacks
- **DDoS Protection**: Rate limiting and traffic analysis
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular automated security assessments

### AI/ML Security
- **Model Security**: Encrypted model storage and signed inference
- **Training Data Protection**: Differential privacy for model training
- **Inference Privacy**: Homomorphic encryption for sensitive queries
- **Model Bias Monitoring**: Regular fairness and bias assessments

## Incident Response & Business Continuity

### Incident Response Plan
1. **Detection**: Automated alerting and monitoring systems
2. **Assessment**: Security team evaluation within 15 minutes
3. **Containment**: Immediate isolation of affected systems
4. **Investigation**: Forensic analysis and root cause determination
5. **Recovery**: System restoration and security improvements
6. **Reporting**: HIPAA breach notification within 60 days

### Disaster Recovery
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours for critical systems
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 15 minutes maximum data loss
- **Backup Strategy**: 3-2-1 backup rule with encrypted offsite storage
- **Failover Testing**: Quarterly disaster recovery exercises

## Compliance Framework

### HIPAA Requirements
- **Administrative Safeguards**: Security officer designation, workforce training
- **Physical Safeguards**: Facility access controls, workstation use restrictions
- **Technical Safeguards**: Access control, audit controls, integrity, transmission security

### Additional Standards
- **HITECH Act**: Enhanced penalties and breach notification requirements
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Annual compliance audits
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Implementation of security controls
- **HL7 FHIR Security**: Adherence to FHIR security best practices
